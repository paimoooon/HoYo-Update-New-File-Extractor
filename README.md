# HoYo Update New File Extractor

Extract newly added files for each upate. Only tested on a dead game yet.

### Prerequisite

- [HoYoStudio 0.80.60](https://gitlab.com/RazTools/Studio/-/releases/v0.80.60)
- tqdm
  ```apache
  pip install tqdm
  ```

### How To Use

1. Build the AssetMap XML files for the old and new clients.

   - In AssetStuidioGUI:  `Misc.` â†’ `Build AssetMap`
   - By [HoYoStudio 0.18.60 CLI](https://gitlab.com/RazTools/Studio/-/releases/v0.18.60):
     Change the constants in `assetmap_xml_extract.py` and then run the script. Note that [HoYoStudio 0.80.60](https://gitlab.com/RazTools/Studio/-/releases/v0.80.60)'s CLI doesn't work.
2. Rename them to `old_assetmap.xml` and `new_assetmap.xml`, then move them into the `./input` folder. They will already be there if you used the `assetmap_xml_extract.py` method.
3. Change the constants in `main.py` to your need, then run the script. The output will be put in the `./output` folder.

### Note

This script parses two XML files and select out the assets with new names in the new XML file. Then it parses the selected assets and extract them one by one using the source path and asset name. This process is not the most optimized, but usable for now at leaset.

An AssetMap XML file looks like this:

```xml
<Assets>
  <Asset>
    <Name>xxxxxx</Name>
    <Container>xxxxxx</Container>
    <Type id="xx">xxxxxxx</Type>
    <PathID>xxxxxxxx<PathID>
    <Source>xxxx</Source>
  </Asset>
  ...
</Assets>
```

If you follow the steps correctly, you will have:

```
  ./input/old_assetmap.xml
  ./input/new_assetmap.xml
  ./output/added_assets.xml
  ./output/<Category>/
```
